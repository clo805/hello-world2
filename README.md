reviewing hello-world
this is my review of hello-world. Im new to programming but Im starting to understand the different concepts. Its getting exciting because I know the basic syntax of programming languages. I just figured out how to input json and html languages into a text editor then display them on a web browser. Ive been picking up the basic syntax but I couldnt understand what to do with them which I still dont but now I can see how a web page is set up.
